This assingment consist of wrinting multiple short programs using what we have covered thus far in class.

Problem #1 consisted of multiple parts. As a whole, it asked for us to create a program that tested the user with multiple arithmatic questions that were securely randomly generated. The difficult and type of question were to be controlable by the user from the outset.

Problem #2 Asked us to create a class called "SavingsAccount" and, through multiple methods and private variables, each object of the class provided utility that would be expected of a Savings Account. Such utilities include calculating monthly interest, adjusting the annual interest rate, etc...

Problem #2 also asked for us to write a program to test the SavingsAccount class.
